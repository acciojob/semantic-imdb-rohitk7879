		In their first year of college, students Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi join the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi and meet Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad aka Rancho, their roommate, who is passionate about experimenting with different things, and consequently tops the class. Rancho's carefree approach to education results in him being at odds with the college's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (nicknamed "Virus" by the students), who believes in a strict and competitive education system.

		3 Idiots (stylized as "3 idiots") is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, edited and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, co-written by Abhijat Joshi and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Adapted loosely from Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone,[5] the film stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi in the titular roles, marking their reunion three years after Rang De Basanti (2006), while Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya star in pivotal roles. Narrated through two parallel dramas, one in the present and the other set ten years in the past, the story follows the friendship of three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under the Indian education system.
